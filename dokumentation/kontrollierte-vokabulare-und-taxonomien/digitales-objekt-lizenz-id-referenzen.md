<br/>

<br/>

**Deutsch:**

Die folgende Liste enthält ID-Referenzen dazu, wie die [**Digitalen-Objekt-Lizenzen**](https://gitlab.git.nrw/arkumu/arkumu-exchange-portal/-/wikis/mappings/arkumu-to-cidoc-mapping#digital-object-licence) innerhalb des arkumu.nrw-Systems angeordnet werden sollten. Die folgende Liste enthält alle Lizenzen, die auch in der Grails-Version von arkumu.nrw enthalten waren. Sie sind nun so geordnet, wie sie in den Access-Datenbanken erscheinen. Die arkumu-Lizenzen sind von den restriktivsten zu den weniger restriktiven sortiert, während die [Creative Commons-Lizenzen](https://de.creativecommons.net/start/)-Lizenzen so sortiert sind, wie sie auf der [Creative Commons-Lizenzseite](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) sowie im [CC-Bereich der Lizenzseite unserer Docs-Website](/ressourcen/lizenzen/) erscheinen. Die Public-Domain-Marke und die EU-Lizenzen für verwaiste Werke wurden ganz am Ende hinzugefügt, da sie sowohl im Grails-System als auch in Access so erschienen sind. Die hinzugefügte Spalte ```Scope``` dient nur als Referenz und ist kein Datenbankfeld.

**English:**

The below lists provides an ID references on how the [**Digital Object Licences**](https://gitlab.git.nrw/arkumu/arkumu-exchange-portal/-/wikis/mappings/arkumu-to-cidoc-mapping#digital-object-licence) in the arkumu.nrw system should be ordered. The list below contains all licenses that were also included in the Grails version of arkumu.nrw. They are now ordered as they appear in the Access databases. The arkumu licenses are ordered from most restrictive to less restrictive, while the [Creative Commomns](https://de.creativecommons.net/start/) licenses are ordered according to how they appear on the [Creative Commons license page](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), as well as in the [CC-section of the licence page of our Docs site](/ressourcen/lizenzen/). The public domain mark and the EU Orphan Work licenses are added at the very end, as they appeared both in the Grails system and in Access. The added `Scope` column is just for reference, and not a database field.
